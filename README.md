# redux-tutorial

=========================

This is a repository that I made while learning redux with node.

## Prerequisites

It is required for you to know a bit of ES6 and ES7 (Object Spread) to correctly understand some of the examples given in this repo. Also be aware that this tutorial targets redux 3.0.2 and react-redux 4.0.0.

## Clone the repository

`https://github.com/akamit21/redux-demo.git`

## Move into repository

`cd redux-tutorial`

## Install dependencies

`npm install`

### Run an example

Being real js files, each example can be run to verify that it works as intended or to do your own experiments:

`node index.js`
`node asyncActions.js`

Enjoy!
